Google Sheets named functions that I find really handy for managing data

I love Google Apps Script, but I prefer Named Functions when possible to implement custom operations in Sheets. In my anecdotal experience, even the hackiest combination of nested `ARRAYFORMULA`s and `QUERY`s will be more performant than a well-designed Apps Script function; and won't present uncertainities or confusion with authorization. I store all my favorite Named functions in a Google Sheet named "functions" and then import functions in new sheets as needed.
